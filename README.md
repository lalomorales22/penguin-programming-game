- **Procedural Level Generation**: Each level is uniquely generated based on coordinates in the virtual world
- **AI-Powered NPCs**: Chat with NPCs powered by advanced language models (Groq API with Llama 3.3), each with unique personalities and knowledge
- **Programming Challenges**: Solve various hacking-themed puzzles including:
  - Terminal command challenges
  - Regular expression pattern matching
  - Encryption/decryption puzzles
  - Logic problems
- **RPG Progression**: Increase skills (hacking, networking, cryptography) and collect access keys
- **Persistent Game State**: Your progress, conversations, and collected items are saved between sessions
- **Retro Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Green terminal text, neon lighting, and hacker vibes throughout

## Technical Details

- **THREE.js** for 3D rendering and environment
- **JavaScript** for game logic and user interaction
- **HTML5/CSS3** for UI elements and styling
- **Groq API** with Llama 3.3 70B model for NPC conversation generation

### Architecture

The game is structured as follows:

- **index.php**: Main entry point handling session management and AJAX requests
- **style.css**: Styling for all UI elements with cyberpunk theme
- **script.js**: Core game engine using THREE.js for rendering and game logic
- **level_generator.php**: Procedural level generation system
- **puzzle_generator.php**: Programming puzzle management
- **npc_handler.php**: NPC interaction system with Groq API integration

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Web server with PHP 7.0+
- Groq API key (set as environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your web server:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lalomorales22/penguin-programming-game.git
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   ```
   # For Linux/Mac
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
   
   # For Windows
   setx GROQ_API_KEY "your_groq_api_key_here"
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the game URL on your server

## How to Play

### Objectives

- Explore the facility and navigate through different server rooms
- Interact with NPCs to gather information about the Iceberg Protocol
- Solve puzzles to increase your skills and gain access to restricted areas
- Find and decode the Iceberg Protocol data

### Controls

- **WASD/Arrow Keys**: Move character
- **Mouse**: Click to move to a location
- **Space**: Interact with nearby objects
- **E**: Access terminal when near a computer
- **ESC**: Close terminal/chat interfaces
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Right-Click + Drag**: Rotate camera

### Terminal Commands

The in-game terminal supports various commands:
- `help`: Display available commands
- `ls`: List files in current directory
- `cat [filename]`: Display file contents
- `whoami`: Display current user information
- `ping`: Test network connection
- `status`: Show system status
- `override --auth=[USERNAME]`: Override security for authorized users
- `search [string]`: Search for files containing string
- `exit`: Close terminal

## Game Mechanics

### Procedural Level Generation

Each level is generated based on its coordinates in the virtual world. Different room templates (server rooms, offices, network hubs) are combined with randomized placement of NPCs, puzzles, and interactive objects.

### NPC Conversations

NPCs use the Groq API with Llama 3.3 70B model to generate contextual responses based on their personality profiles:
- **Sysadmin**: Technical, paranoid about security breaches
- **Junior Technician**: Nervous, accidentally shares sensitive information
- **Security AI**: Cold, precise, monitors for unauthorized access
- **Hacker**: Uses slang, helps player for their own agenda
- **Corporate Executive**: Arrogant, focused on the Iceberg Protocol

### Puzzle Types

- **Terminal Commands**: Execute correct Unix/Linux commands to access hidden data
- **Regex Patterns**: Create regular expressions that match specific patterns
- **Encryption Challenges**: Decode messages using various cryptographic techniques
- **Logic Puzzles**: Solve sequence and pattern problems

### Skills & Progression

Successfully completing puzzles rewards you with:
- **Skill Improvements**: Hacking, Networking, Cryptography
- **Access Keys**: Unlock restricted areas and systems
- **Story Progress**: Uncover more about the Iceberg Protocol

## Development Roadmap

Future development plans include:

- **Additional Puzzle Types**: SQL injection, code debugging, circuit puzzles
- **Boss Challenges**: Major security barriers requiring multiple skills
- **Expanded Storyline**: More detailed quests and narrative
- **Visual Upgrades**: Character customization and visual skill effects
- **Multiplayer Support**: Allow multiple hackers to collaborate

## AI Integration

The NPCs in Penguin Hacker RPG leverage state-of-the-art language models to create dynamic and realistic conversations:

- **Groq API**: High-performance inference API used to communicate with the language model
- **Llama 3.3 70B Versatile**: Meta AI's large language model used for generating contextually relevant NPC responses
- **Custom Personality Prompts**: Each NPC type has a unique persona and knowledge base that influences their responses
- **Conversation Memory**: The game maintains a history of your conversations with each NPC for continuity
